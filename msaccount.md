## Playing with a Microsoft Account

Users who have merged their Mojang accounts, or new copies of Minecraft, are forced to login with their Microsoft accounts for Xbox Live integration. This login system is much safer than the old system and will hopefully cut down on the number of stolen Minecraft accounts.  

There's only one big issue; most 3rd party launchers don't support the new login system. Technic, GDLauncher, MultiMC and most likely more are all incompatible with the new login system. This is a big problem if you want to play on the Big Dogs MC server.  

However, there is a workaround. Using the [CurseForge launcher!](https://curseforge.overwolf.com/)  

#### Setting up a CurseForge profile

- After installing CurseForge, select Minecraft and create a custom profile.  
- Select Minecraft version 1.16.4, and Forge 35.1.7.
- Wait for the setup to complete. Right click on the profile you just created, and open folder.
- Download and copy the contents of the latest update [(1.0)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/btan9xn5dh80hhx/Val3BD.zip?dl=1) into the folder. (Merge "mods" with "mods", etc)
- As long as your RAM is properly allocated in CurseForge's settings, you're ready to play!

Enjoy!
