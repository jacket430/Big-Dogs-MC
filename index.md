The server IP address is `4.71.159.140:25565`

Please make sure you have the [64-bit version of Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp) installed, and at least 6-8GB RAM allocated in your respective launchers settings.

The next pack, Big Dogs MC, is currently under development and more information will be posted as the pack nears completion!

Game on gamers,
